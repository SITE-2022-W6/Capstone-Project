## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 Implemented adding and deleting reviews

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 There was an issue with getting some stuff to display on the website. It turned out that we were trying to access a variable that ahd not been set yet. So we just had to wait until it was set, and then access it.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

Yes, we were able to finish all of out tasks for this week. 

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

The feedback from TAs and mentors really helped give us new ideas and perspectives on our site. It highlighted some issues that we overlooked as creators of the site.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 No features are at risk
