## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

We got the reviews implemented to the restaurants' item, a feature that prevent the address state to clear when the page refreshed and created the recommended list

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

We tried to implimeneted the recommended filter for the user but Andy has a hard time implementing that feature to the frontend

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

We finished nearly all of the sprint, expect for one, which is to display message when there are no more restautants to load.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

None of the resources provided to our help prepare us in planning and executing us capstone project sprint this week. 

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

There's not user stories that are at risk.
