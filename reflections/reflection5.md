## Reflection Questions

* How was the pacing of the capstone project? (i.e too slow, just right, too fast) 

The pacing of the capstone project was between slow and just right.

* To what extent did your plan change over the course of development? Knowing that you know now, what would you do differently if you were starting over?

We don't plan to change over the course of development. We'll start doing the same stuff that we've done a bit early and faster.

* How helpful were the labs and weekly assignments in preparing you to create a capstone project? Be specific, what topics do you still have questions about that may or may not have been covered?

we'll say that the laba are really helpfull when it comes to creating the project like implementing the backend to the frontend and connecting the postgres to the backend.

* When planning for the capstone project, which resources were the most helpful? (i.e mentors, instructors & TAs, ideation process, pod syncs, wireframes, sprint planning, bug bash, practice demo day, etc.)

The spring planning and the pod syncs are the resources that are very helpful for our capstone project.
