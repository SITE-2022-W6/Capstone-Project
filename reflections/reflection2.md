## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.
* 
We are able to view a list of restaurants, get the menus for each restaurant, and see specific menu item details

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

Connecting the frontend to the backend. There are some functions that we still have to hook up to the front end. There were several times the frontend needed more information from the backend, so we had to modify what the calls to the backend returned.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

Yes, we finished the tasks that we planned for this week. Becauase we were unable to finish last week, we reevaluated how much we could complete in a week, and we did better in managing our workload this time.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

Yes, they did help. Roy provided excellent tips on how to compare our product to other competitors, and Yilika gave us some advice on how to store images in our database

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

There are currently no features that we consider "at risk"
