## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

Most of the frontend is completed.
We are able to make calls to the API and get usable information from it.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

One of the biggest challenges we faced was having to refocus our project. Originally, we wanted to create a delivery app. And we thought we found an API that would provide use with relevant information, such as the price and calorie for a dish. However, after we made some calls to the API, we found out that the information provided was not as detailed as we thought. For example, all the prices were blank. So we had to refocus our project to be about rating menu items and getting foods recommended to you.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

We did not manage to finish all of our tasks. We moved those tasks to the second sprint. We had to pivot from our original plan, and some bugs took longer than we thought to fix. However, now that we have a clear focus and idea for how much work we can get done, we will be able to plan our work out better in our next sprint.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

The resources were helpful for the mst part, it gave us examples and guided us in planning our project. However, there was some confusion over how to set up the project boards and milestones, and that caused a bit of confusion when we had to restructure it.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?
The features and user stories that are "at risk" are the ones that pertain to the restaurant and delivery users. Because we pivoted from our initial plan, those features may not be implemented.
