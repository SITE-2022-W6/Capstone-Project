# Project Proposal

Pod Members: **Winson Chen, Andy Cordero, Steven Salto**

## Problem Statement
When there's not enough time to cook, or cooking is too much of a hassle, many people will choose to order food on a delivery app. These days, there are many apps that try to fill this niche, such as Uber Eats, Grubhub, Doordash, etc. However, with these apps also comes a multitude of different restaurants and dishes that can feel overwhelming. A solution to this problem would be to create a delivery app that also has a built in system where users can rate or comment on a specific food item, making it easier for a user to make an informed decision about a dish before they order it.

## Description
The main purpose of our project is to create a delivery website that also has a rating and comment system for each menu item. Users will select a restaurant and then will be able to see the menu. Clicking on a specific food item will allow them to order it, post a comment, or rate the dish.

## Expected Features List
- See menu items when selecting a restaurant
- Rate a menu item
- Comment on a menu item
- See dishes with similar ratings from same or other restaurant
- Receive a receipt with order summary

## Related Work
- Uber Eats
- Grubhub
- Doordash
- Food delivery apps in general

Our website will differ from them becasue users will be able to rate and comment on menu items


## Open Questions
We will need to get learn more about APIs and possible SQL in order to get them menu items and keep a database of ratings and comments
