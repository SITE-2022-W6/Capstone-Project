## Problem Statement
Finding a place to eat out can be hard, you need to figure out what you want kind of cuisine you want to eat, which restaurant to go to, and which dish to order. Food review sites can help with that problem, by letting you see other people's reactions and thoughts about a restaurant. However, the vast majority of food review sites do not have an option to review a specific menu item. This can make it hard to pick which dish you want to eat. A solution to this problem, which The Foodie Express implements, is to have ratings and reviews on each menu item. The Foodie Express will also have a recommendation system in order to make it easier to find restaurants that you enjoy.

## Description
The main purpose of our project is to create a food review website that also has a rating and review system for each menu item. Users will select a restaurant and then will be able to see the menu. Clicking on a specific food item will allow them to view details about that food and post a review or rate the dish.

## Expected Features List
- See menu items when selecting a restaurant
- Rate a menu item
- Review a menu item
- Edit a review

## Open Questions
